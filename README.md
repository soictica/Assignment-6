# Assignment-6
a) What is the purpose of this program(s)?
The purpose of this program is twofold: One is to find the mean, median, and mode of a select problem. The second is to convert charecters in between decimals, octals, and ascii to decode a list

b) What does this program take as input?
This program takes user input, with the user inputting an upper value, a lower value, and a step value for problem 1, and a code for problem 2

c) What is the expected out put of the program?
The expected outcome of this program is to find the mean, median, and mode of a select problem, and to convert charecters in between decimals, octals, and ascii in order to decode a list

d) What type of execution is included in your program?
My program includes user inputs, lists, conditionals, for loops, list commands, defined functions

e) How could your program be improved?
I think if my program could output the ascii charecter that is desired, it would be nicer, however the TA told me that what I had filled the requirements.
